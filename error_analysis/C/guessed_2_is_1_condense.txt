\par RUSSIA RESUMES GAS SHIPMENTS TO \underline{BELARUS}.

The spat erupted Monday when Russia began cutting flows of natural gas into \underline{Belarus} in an effort to recover nearly $ 200 million in debt for unpaid energy deliveries. It escalated when \underline{Belarus} restricted the transit of Russian gas into Europe. On Thursday, Russia 's government owned gas company, Gazprom, resumed the flow of natural gas in full to \underline{Belarus} after the country settled its debt, Aleksei B.

Gazprom confirmed that it paid $ 228 million on Thursday, but this did not appear to satisfy \underline{Belarusian} officials. Gas was nevertheless transported normally through \underline{Belarus} into Europe on Thursday, a day after \textbf{Lithuania} registered a 40 percent cut in energy flows into the country. \textbf{Lithuania} is the only European Union member that receives 100 percent of \textbf{its} gas through \underline{Belarusian} pipelines, though Germany and Poland partially rely on such supplies. `` We expect now that the flows can be restored to European customers and that they should not be affected by the disputes or disagreements concerning the transit fees, '' Marlene Holzner, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said at a news conference. The spat between \underline{Belarus} and Russia is not the first to leave Europe at risk of energy deficits, and has again raised questions about Russia 's ability to reliably deliver gas to its customers in the European Union just as Moscow has been seeking to boost its image as a dependable business partner in the West. Russia has been embroiled in several similar disputes with \underline{Belarus} and another neighbor, Ukraine, typically in winter months when the effects of gas shutoffs are graver.

\par \textbf{RUSSIA} RESUMES GAS SHIPMENTS TO BELARUS. \textbf{Russian} natural gas started flowing back through pipelines into Europe at normal levels on Thursday, as Belarus and \textbf{Russia} announced a tentative truce in their four-day energy dispute. The spat erupted Monday when \textbf{Russia} began cutting flows of natural gas into Belarus in an effort to recover nearly $ 200 million in debt for unpaid energy deliveries. It escalated when Belarus restricted the transit of \textbf{Russian} gas into Europe. On Thursday, \textbf{\textbf{Russia} 's} government owned gas company, Gazprom, resumed the flow of natural gas in full to Belarus after the country settled its debt, \underline{Aleksei B. Miller}, \underline{Gazprom 's chief executive}, said. `` But the issue is not yet fully solved, '' \underline{Miller} said. Belarus, \underline{he} said, sent a letter demanding \textbf{Russia} pay transit fees for natural gas pumped through pipelines on \textbf{its} territory. `` If the demand outlined in the letter is not met, the Belarusian side has threatened to cut off transits through the territory of Belarus, '' \underline{he} said. Belarus has maintained since the beginning of the standoff that \textbf{Russia} owned $ 260 million in unpaid transit fees. Gazprom confirmed that it paid $ 228 million on Thursday, but this did not appear to satisfy Belarusian officials.

\par Slovenia ` disappointed' at EU ambassadors' nomination. Slovenia expressed `` deep disappointment '' on Wednesday, after EU foreign policy supremo Catherine Ashton failed to nominate any Slovenian in her first batch of EU ambassadorial appointments. `` We are deeply disappointed, '' Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said in a first reaction. `` We expected more transparent decisions and that geographic balance would be taken into account, in particular for those states, like Slovenia, which have no presence at all in the EU 's foreign institutions, '' Zbogar told journalists. He added it was `` not clear '' why Ashton had not selected `` at least one of the excellent candidates '' Slovenia had proposed. Ashton on Wednesday named the EU 's first 29 ambassadorial postings, with big nations such as France, \underline{Germany} and \textbf{Spain} cornering some of the top jobs. Slovenia, which joined the EU in 2004 and is one of the bloc 's smallest members, put forward candidates for the ambassadorial posts in Albania and Macedonia, which ultimately went to Italy and Denmark respectively. Zbogar insisted that Ashton 's announcement showed `` too little political understanding for the interests of smaller newer member countries '' and did not bode well for the future common diplomatic service. `` This first appointment represents a missed chance, '' he said. `` We hope that in future opportunities, the high representative -LRB- Ashton -RRB- will take into account the geographic balance as she promised to do, '' he added.
\par ` Alan Wake' inspired by Stephen King, David Lynch. Ask most video-game designers about their inspirations and they will mention other games. But Sam Lake, the lead writer of Microsoft 's `` Alan Wake, '' drew more from books, especially Stephen King 's. `` The setup of the game -- a best-selling but troubled writer whose dark work of fiction starts to come true, blurring the line of nightmares and reality -- is a very Stephen King type of a starting point for a story, so King 's works were definitely a source of inspiration for us, '' says Lake, whose script name-checks the horror master right at the start. But King is not the only author on Lake 's shelf. He also cites Paul Auster 's `` The \underline{Book of Illusions}, '' \textbf{Bret Easton Ellis}' `` Lunar Park '' and Mark Z. Danielewski 's `` House of Leaves, '' all of which tackle questions of reality vs. illusion. The setting for `` Alan Wake, '' a quirky small town in the Pacific Northwest, will remind many players of `` Twin Peaks, '' and Lake welcomes the comparison, praising `` the creepy atmosphere and the humor to balance that out '' in David Lynch 's landmark TV series. Lake says he and the other developers at the Remedy Entertainment studio also are big fans of `` Lost '' : `` It 's a very good showcase of thriller pacing done right within a TV-series context. '' Indeed, `` Alan Wake '' has the feeling of a TV drama : It is divided into `` episodes, '' each beginning with a `` Previously on ` Alan Wake' '' recap. And Lake is hoping the `` series '' gets renewed. The team at Remedy is working on downloadable content for the game, which Lake sees `` almost as a special feature of a TV series, something that builds a bridge between one season and the next, or in this case, the first game and the potential sequel. '' `` If the players like the game and want more, we 'd certainly like to do more, '' Lake says. `` From the very beginning we have planned ` Alan Wake' to be something bigger than just one game.

\par RUSSIA RESUMES GAS SHIPMENTS TO BELARUS. Russian natural gas started flowing back through pipelines into Europe at normal levels on Thursday, as Belarus and Russia announced a tentative truce in their four-day energy dispute. The spat erupted Monday when Russia began cutting flows of natural gas into Belarus in an effort to recover nearly $ 200 million in debt for unpaid energy deliveries. It escalated when Belarus restricted the transit of Russian gas into Europe. On Thursday, Russia 's government owned gas company, Gazprom, resumed the flow of natural gas in full to Belarus after the country settled its debt, \underline{Aleksei B. Miller}, \underline{Gazprom 's chief executive}, said. `` But the issue is not yet fully solved, '' \underline{Miller} said. Belarus, \underline{he} said, sent a letter demanding Russia pay transit fees for natural gas pumped through pipelines on its territory. `` If the demand outlined in the letter is not met, the Belarusian side has threatened to cut off transits through the territory of Belarus, '' \underline{he} said. Belarus has maintained since the beginning of the standoff that Russia owned $ 260 million in unpaid transit fees. Gazprom confirmed that it paid $ 228 million on Thursday, but this did not appear to satisfy Belarusian officials. Gas was nevertheless transported normally through Belarus into Europe on Thursday, a day after Lithuania registered a 40 percent cut in energy flows into the country. Lithuania is the only \textbf{European Union} member that receives 100 percent of its gas through Belarusian pipelines, though Germany and Poland partially rely on such supplies. `` We expect now that the flows can be restored to European customers and that they should not be affected by the disputes or disagreements concerning the transit fees, '' Marlene Holzner, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said at a news conference. The spat between Belarus and Russia is not the first to leave Europe at risk of energy deficits, and has again raised questions about Russia 's ability to reliably deliver gas to its customers in \textbf{the \textbf{European Union}} just as Moscow has been seeking to boost its image as a dependable business partner in the West. Russia has been embroiled in several similar disputes with Belarus and another neighbor, Ukraine, typically in winter months when the effects of gas shutoffs are graver.

The Philippine government said it supports the \textbf{Commission on Elections}' -LRB- Comelec -RRB- decision to push through with automated polls on Monday, and urged the public, especially political groups, to trust the better judgment of the poll body. `` We defer to the discretion and in this case, to the due diligence as well of Comelec in making a judgment call on an issue like postponement, '' \underline{Deputy Presidential Spokesperson \underline{Gary Olivar}} said Wednesday.

\par RUSSIA RESUMES GAS SHIPMENTS TO BELARUS. Russian natural gas started flowing back through pipelines into Europe at normal levels on Thursday, as Belarus and Russia announced a tentative truce in their four-day energy dispute. The spat erupted Monday when Russia began cutting flows of natural gas into Belarus in an effort to recover nearly $ 200 million in debt for unpaid energy deliveries. It escalated when Belarus restricted the transit of Russian gas into Europe. On Thursday, Russia 's government owned gas company, Gazprom, resumed the flow of natural gas in full to Belarus after the country settled its debt, Aleksei B. Miller, Gazprom 's chief executive, said. `` But the issue is not yet fully solved, '' Miller said. Belarus, he said, sent a letter demanding Russia pay transit fees for natural gas pumped through pipelines on its territory. `` If the demand outlined in the letter is not met, the Belarusian side has threatened to cut off transits through the territory of Belarus, '' he said. Belarus has maintained since the beginning of the standoff that Russia owned $ 260 million in unpaid transit fees. Gazprom confirmed that it paid $ 228 million on Thursday, but this did not appear to satisfy Belarusian officials. Gas was nevertheless transported normally through Belarus into Europe on Thursday, a day after \textbf{Lithuania} registered a 40 percent cut in energy flows into the country. \textbf{Lithuania} is the only European Union member that receives 100 percent of \textbf{its} gas through Belarusian pipelines, though \underline{Germany} and Poland partially rely on such supplies. `` We expect now that the flows can be restored to European customers and that they should not be affected by the disputes or disagreements concerning the transit fees, '' Marlene Holzner, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said at a news conference. The spat between Belarus and Russia is not the first to leave Europe at risk of energy deficits, and has again raised questions about Russia 's ability to reliably deliver gas to its customers in the European Union just as Moscow has been seeking to boost its image as a dependable business partner in the West. Russia has been embroiled in several similar disputes with Belarus and another neighbor, Ukraine, typically in winter months when the effects of gas shutoffs are graver.

\par Woman Wall Street Hates Most Is Right for the Job. Seventy-five years ago this month, a Lockheed Orion Explorer airplane crashed in Point Barrow, \underline{Alaska}. The one passenger, a rugged man originally from Oklahoma Indian Territory, died on impact along with the pilot. The dead passenger had stalked Washington insiders for decades and those who had been in his sights breathed a sigh of relief. But the rest of the nation mourned Will Rogers. Now another plain-spoken Oklahoman, this time a 61-year-old grandmother named \textbf{Elizabeth Warren}, is chasing some Washington special-interest folks up hill and down dale simply by standing up for consumers and politely saying out loud what ordinary Americans are thinking. Before some in the financial industry and their capital cohorts continue their attacks on \textbf{Warren}, they would be well advised to consider some of Will Rogers' sage advice that has stood the test of time : Lettin' the cat out of the bag is a whole lot easier than puttin' it back in. Earlier this month, an industry lobbyist said \textbf{Warren} could n't manage the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a fair and balanced way because \textbf{she} wants to protect ordinary Americans from bad financial products. In other words : Anyone who has been involved in consumer protection should be disqualified from heading an agency that was created to provide protection to consumers. Go figure. In recent years, most people appointed as federal financial-industry regulators have either been lobbyists or have come from inside the industry. So it 's not surprising that many Americans are fed up and furious about the revolving door between industry and federal agencies. If industry is going to fight the appointment of regulators simply because they have a background in consumer advocacy, it is high time for a full public airing of the qualifications and industry ties of appointees over the last decade and the results -- preferably through the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. Do industry leaders really want this cat out of the bag ? There is nothing in \textbf{Warren 's} long academic and public - service record that indicates any unwillingness to consider all sides of a question.

\par \underline{RUSSIA} RESUMES GAS SHIPMENTS TO BELARUS. \underline{Russian} natural gas started flowing back through pipelines into Europe at normal levels on Thursday, as Belarus and \underline{Russia} announced a tentative truce in their four-day energy dispute. The spat erupted Monday when \underline{Russia} began cutting flows of natural gas into Belarus in an effort to recover nearly $ 200 million in debt for unpaid energy deliveries. It escalated when Belarus restricted the transit of \underline{Russian} gas into Europe. On Thursday, \underline{\underline{Russia} 's} government owned gas company, Gazprom, resumed the flow of natural gas in full to Belarus after the country settled its debt, Aleksei B. Miller, Gazprom 's chief executive, said. `` But the issue is not yet fully solved, '' Miller said. Belarus, he said, sent a letter demanding \underline{Russia} pay transit fees for natural gas pumped through pipelines on \underline{its} territory. `` If the demand outlined in the letter is not met, the Belarusian side has threatened to cut off transits through the territory of Belarus, '' he said. Belarus has maintained since the beginning of the standoff that \underline{Russia} owned $ 260 million in unpaid transit fees. Gazprom confirmed that it paid $ 228 million on Thursday, but this did not appear to satisfy Belarusian officials. Gas was nevertheless transported normally through Belarus into Europe on Thursday, a day after Lithuania registered a 40 percent cut in energy flows into the country. Lithuania is the only \textbf{European Union} member that receives 100 percent of its gas through Belarusian pipelines, though Germany and Poland partially rely on such supplies. `` We expect now that the flows can be restored to European customers and that they should not be affected by the disputes or disagreements concerning the transit fees, '' Marlene Holzner, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said at a news conference. The spat between Belarus and \underline{Russia} is not the first to leave Europe at risk of energy deficits, and has again raised questions about \underline{\underline{Russia} 's} ability to reliably deliver gas to its customers in \textbf{the \textbf{European Union}} just as Moscow has been seeking to boost its image as a dependable business partner in the West. \underline{Russia} has been embroiled in several similar disputes with Belarus and another neighbor, Ukraine, typically in winter months when the effects of gas shutoffs are graver.

\par ` Alan Wake' inspired by Stephen King, \underline{David Lynch}. Ask most video-game designers about their inspirations and they will mention other games. But Sam Lake, the lead writer of Microsoft 's `` Alan Wake, '' drew more from books, especially Stephen King 's. `` The setup of the game -- a best-selling but troubled writer whose dark work of fiction starts to come true, blurring the line of nightmares and reality -- is a very Stephen King type of a starting point for a story, so King 's works were definitely a source of inspiration for us, '' says Lake, whose script name-checks the horror master right at the start. But King is not the only author on Lake 's shelf. He also cites Paul Auster 's `` The \textbf{Book of Illusions}, '' Bret Easton Ellis' `` Lunar Park '' and Mark Z. Danielewski 's `` House of Leaves, '' all of which tackle questions of reality vs. illusion. The setting for `` Alan Wake, '' a quirky small town in the Pacific Northwest, will remind many players of `` Twin Peaks, '' and Lake welcomes the comparison, praising `` the creepy atmosphere and the humor to balance that out '' in \underline{\underline{David Lynch} 's} landmark TV series. Lake says he and the other developers at the Remedy Entertainment studio also are big fans of `` Lost '' : `` It 's a very good showcase of thriller pacing done right within a TV-series context. '' Indeed, `` Alan Wake '' has the feeling of a TV drama : It is divided into `` episodes, '' each beginning with a `` Previously on ` Alan Wake' '' recap. And Lake is hoping the `` series '' gets renewed. The team at Remedy is working on downloadable content for the game, which Lake sees `` almost as a special feature of a TV series, something that builds a bridge between one season and the next, or in this case, the first game and the potential sequel. '' `` If the players like the game and want more, we 'd certainly like to do more, '' Lake says. `` From the very beginning we have planned ` Alan Wake' to be something bigger than just one game.

\par Woman Wall Street Hates Most Is Right for the Job. Seventy-five years ago this month, a Lockheed Orion Explorer airplane crashed in Point Barrow, Alaska. The one passenger, a rugged man originally from Oklahoma Indian Territory, died on impact along with the pilot. The dead passenger had stalked Washington insiders for decades and those who had been in his sights breathed a sigh of relief. But the rest of the nation mourned Will Rogers. Now another plain-spoken Oklahoman, this time a 61-year-old grandmother named \underline{Elizabeth Warren}, is chasing some Washington special-interest folks up hill and down dale simply by standing up for consumers and politely saying out loud what ordinary Americans are thinking. Before some in the financial industry and their capital cohorts continue their attacks on \underline{Warren}, they would be well advised to consider some of Will Rogers' sage advice that has stood the test of time : Lettin' the cat out of the bag is a whole lot easier than puttin' it back in. Earlier this month, an industry lobbyist said \underline{Warren} could n't manage the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a fair and balanced way because \underline{she} wants to protect ordinary Americans from bad financial products. In other words : Anyone who has been involved in consumer protection should be disqualified from heading an agency that was created to provide protection to consumers. Go figure. In recent years, most people appointed as federal financial-industry regulators have either been lobbyists or have come from inside the industry. So it 's not surprising that many Americans are fed up and furious about the revolving door between industry and federal agencies. If industry is going to fight the appointment of regulators simply because they have a background in consumer advocacy, it is high time for a full public airing of the qualifications and industry ties of appointees over the last decade and the results -- preferably through the \textbf{Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission}. Do industry leaders really want this cat out of the bag ? There is nothing in \underline{Warren 's} long academic and public - service record that indicates any unwillingness to consider all sides of a question.
\par Ban on \underline{Chinese} investment contrary to Australian interest : Deputy PM. Australian Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard on Monday said the opposition 's calls for a ban on \underline{Chinese} investment in \textbf{Australia} are irresponsible and contrary to the national interest. National 's senator and opposition finance spokesman Barnaby Joyce last week warned against \underline{Chinese} state-owned companies investing in the Australian resources sector. Gillard spoke to reporters after meeting with the \underline{Chinese} secretary of Jiangsu Province, Liang Baohua, in Melbourne. She said Joyce 's views threatened to cut \textbf{Australia} off from the rest of the world and make \textbf{it} less economically sound. `` They are erratic and irresponsible comments that are contrary to this nation 's national interest. `` Our vision of this country is for it to be a prosperous country, engaged with the world, to do that you need to trade with the rest of the world, '' Gillard told reporters. Joyce backed away from his comments on Monday, but Gillard said the damage had already been done ; suggesting Joyce needed to take responsibility for his actions. `` If you want to be a national leader, particularly in an economic portfolio, then you have to accept the responsibility that your statements matter, that other countries listen to your statements ... that what you say today, can impact on the living standards of Australians tomorrow, '' she said.

\par Roundup : Video sparks new Ecuador-Colombia row. Ties between Ecuador and Colombia have been further strained with the emergence of a video accusing \underline{Ecuadorian} President Rafael Correa of having a financial link with the largest Colombian guerilla group. The video, which was provided by the Colombian government, showed that `` Mono Jojoy, '' an alias for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -LRB- FARC -RRB- leader Jorge Briceno, had offered money toward Correa 's 2006 election campaign. The video has triggered new conflict between the two neighbors which were on the verge of a war when Colombia crossed the border in March last year to crack down on FARC rebels. Denying the accusation, \underline{Ecuadorian} Vice President Lenin Moreno on Monday described the video as `` edited, '' suggesting that it must have been made in the neighboring country `` as we are used to the behavior of the Colombian government. '' `` It is very difficult for the FARC, a clandestine group, to record such an act on film with such perfection. It is a film out of Hollywood, '' Moreno said. He said the accusation was well planned, and `` such accusations are made from time to time. '' Correa said such accusations are `` faked '' and are `` attacks from conservative groups in the continent. '' `` They want to take me to the International Penal Court for being a terrorist in order to mask the true terrorists, the drug trafficking-politicians and the para-politicians, '' Correa said. He proposed that he and his Colombian counterpart Alvaro Uribe both go before the International Penal Court to face questions about ties to the FARC, and drug-trafficking. Correa said he was also willing to take a lie-detector test. \underline{Ecuadorian} Foreign Minister \textbf{Fander Falconi}, said the declarations in the video `` come from a leader of a rebel group, and this leader has made many declarations against the Colombian government. '' \textbf{Falconi} said that if the FARC 's accusations against the Colombian authorities have not been taken seriously, then what FARC says about Ecuador `` should also not be taken seriously.

\par Goldman fined $ 650,000 for disclosure lapse. Industry regulators have fined Goldman Sachs $ 650,000 for failing to disclose that two of its brokers, including the executive accused of leading the mortgage securities deal that brought civil fraud charges against the firm, were under investigation by the government. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced the fine Tuesday, saying Goldman lacked adequate procedures to ensure that the required disclosure was made for Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman vice president. Goldman made that report last May, more than seven months after Tourre received a notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was considering filing charges against him, \textbf{FINRA} said. Goldman settled the SEC 's fraud charges in July, paying a record $ 550 million. The case was the most significant legal action related to the mortgage meltdown that pushed the country into recession.

The SEC had alleged in that case that Goldman sold mortgage invstments without telling buyers that the securities had been crafted with input from a client that was betting on them to fail. The securities cost two European banks close to $ 1 billion while helping Goldman client Paulson & Co. capitalize on the housing bust, the SEC said in the charges filed in April.

\par Group urges engagement with authoritarian Eritrea. A new report says the international community must engage more with the authoritarian leadership of Eritrea to prevent the tiny Red Sea nation from becoming another failed state in the Horn of Africa. The International Crisis Group says the effects of Eritrea 's 1998-2000 war with Ethiopia, an economy in freefall and rising poverty are hemorrhaging the legitimacy of the authoritarian political system in the country. The report -- `` Eritrea : The Siege State '' -- was released late Tuesday. In late 2009, the \textbf{U.N. Security Council} imposed an arms embargo and other sanctions against Eritrea for supplying weapons to insurgents opposed to the \underline{Somali} government and refusing to resolve a border dispute with neighboring Djibouti, a key U.S. ally.

The group has been accused of being involved in illegal activities such as kidnapping and killing, the police said, adding that they were combing the area for other members of the group. Colombia and \textbf{Venezuela} share a 2,200-km-long border, an ideal place for Colombian paramilitaries, guerrillas and drug - traffickers to carry out all kinds of criminal activities. \textbf{Venezuelan} President \underline{Hugo Chavez} severed diplomatic relations with Colombia last Thursday after Colombia condemned \textbf{Venezuela} for sheltering Colombian guerrilla chiefs.

Relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia had long been strained since Eritrea formally gained its independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year war.

\par Eight out of ten \textbf{Italians} back crucifix in schools : poll. An opinion poll on Sunday showed strong public support for displaying crucifixes in \textbf{Italy} 's schools, five days after a European court ruled the practice breached human rights. More than eight out of ten \textbf{Italians} said they supported crucifixes being shown in schools, according to a survey published in the Corriera della Sera newspaper. \textbf{Italian} politicians of all sides united with the \underline{Catholic Church} to condemn the November 3 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights -LRB- ECHR -RRB-, with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi describing it as `` unacceptable ''. In Sunday 's poll, 84 percent of people replied `` yes '' to the question `` Should crucifixes be displayed in classrooms ? '', 14 percent said `` no '' and 2 percent said they had no opinion. The percentage who said `` yes '' rose to 86 percent among those who went to mass `` several times a year '' and to 93 percent among those who went to church `` at least once a week ''. Even non-churchgoers supported the crucifix, with 68 percent of people who said they never went to mass in favour of displaying it in schools. Political commentator Renato Mannheimer said a significant proportion of \textbf{Italians} see the crucifix primarily as a symbol of their country 's cultural and social traditions, though they do not deny its religious significance. The ECHR ruling came in a case brought by an \textbf{Italian} mother opposed to the presence of the crucifix in schools. Soile Lautsi took her fight to Strasbourg after \textbf{Italian} judges finally ruled against her following years of legal wrangling, declaring on more than one occasion that the crucifix had become as much a symbol of \textbf{Italian} national identity as of Catholicism. The ECHR found that the right of parents to educate their children according to their own beliefs, and children 's right to freedom of religion, were breached by the crucifix in classrooms. They could also be `` disturbing for pupils '' from other religions and ethnic minorities, the court found, declaring a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. The ISPO organisation surveyed 801 people for the poll, which had a 3.5 percent margin of error.

Ties between Ecuador and Colombia have been further strained with the emergence of a video accusing \textbf{Ecuadorian} President Rafael Correa of having a financial link with the largest Colombian guerilla group. The video, which was provided by the Colombian government, showed that `` Mono Jojoy, '' an alias for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -LRB- FARC -RRB- leader Jorge Briceno, had offered money toward Correa 's 2006 election campaign. The video has triggered new conflict between the two neighbors which were on the verge of a war when Colombia crossed the border in March last year to crack down on FARC rebels. Denying the accusation, \textbf{Ecuadorian} Vice President Lenin Moreno on Monday described the video as `` edited, '' suggesting that it must have been made in the neighboring country `` as we are used to the behavior of the Colombian government. '' `` It is very difficult for the FARC, a clandestine group, to record such an act on film with such perfection. It is a film out of Hollywood, '' Moreno said. He said the accusation was well planned, and `` such accusations are made from time to time. '' Correa said such accusations are `` faked '' and are `` attacks from conservative groups in the continent. '' `` They want to take me to the International Penal Court for being a terrorist in order to mask the true terrorists, the drug trafficking-politicians and the para-politicians, '' Correa said. He proposed that he and his Colombian counterpart Alvaro Uribe both go before the International Penal Court to face questions about ties to the FARC, and drug-trafficking. Correa said he was also willing to take a lie-detector test. \textbf{Ecuadorian} Foreign Minister \underline{Fander Falconi}, said the declarations in the video `` come from a leader of a rebel group, and this leader has made many declarations against the Colombian government. '' \underline{Falconi} said that if the FARC 's accusations against the Colombian authorities have not been taken seriously, then what FARC says about Ecuador `` should also not be taken seriously.

The Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LRB- \textbf{DPRK} -RRB- Wednesday said the U.S. occupation in \underline{South Korea} destroys peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea issued a statement that said `` neither peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula nor peace and security in Northeast Asia are thinkable as long as the U.S. forces are present in \underline{South Korea}. '' The United States was the `` arch criminal, '' who divided Korea into the north and the south, bringing misfortune and pain to the Korean Peninsula and it was `` the root cause '' of aggression and war, the statement said.

\par RETURN OF THE SECRET DONORS. To old political hands, wise to the ways of candidates and money, 1972 was a watershed year. \underline{Richard M. Nixon} 's re-election campaign was awash in cash, secretly donated by corporations and individuals. Fred Wertheimer, a longtime supporter of campaign finance regulation, was then a lawyer for Common Cause. He vividly recalls the weeks leading up to April 7, 1972, before a new campaign finance law went into effect requiring the disclosure of the names of individual donors. `` Contributors, '' he said, `` were literally flying into Washington with satchels of cash. '' The Committee for the Re-Election of the President was also illegally hauling in many millions of dollars from corporations, many of which felt pressured into making contributions. The record of donors was so tightly held that it was kept in a locked drawer by \textbf{Rose Mary Woods}, \underline{Nixon} 's secretary. The list -- which came to be known as `` \textbf{Rose Mary 's} Baby '' -- was n't released until Wertheimer forced the issue through a lawsuit. Among those on the list were William Keeler, the chief executive of Phillips Petroleum, who pleaded guilty during the post-Watergate prosecutions to making an illegal corporate donation. \textbf{Rose Mary 's} Baby \textbf{itself}, now an artifact of the nation 's biggest political scandal, sits in the Watergate collection of the National Archives. In this year 's midterm elections, there is no talk of satchels of cash from donors. Nor is there any hint of illegal actions reaching Watergate-like proportions. But the fundraising practices that earned people convictions in Watergate -- giving direct corporate money to a campaign and doing so secretly -- are back in a different form in 2010. This time around, the corporations are still giving secretly, but legally.

\par Eight out of ten Italians back crucifix in schools : poll. An opinion poll on Sunday showed strong public support for displaying crucifixes in Italy 's schools, five days after a European court ruled the practice breached human rights. More than eight out of ten Italians said they supported crucifixes being shown in schools, according to a survey published in the Corriera della Sera newspaper. Italian politicians of all sides united with the \underline{Catholic Church} to condemn the November 3 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights -LRB- ECHR -RRB-, with Prime Minister \textbf{Silvio Berlusconi} describing it as `` unacceptable ''. In Sunday 's poll, 84 percent of people replied `` yes '' to the question `` Should crucifixes be displayed in classrooms ? '', 14 percent said `` no '' and 2 percent said they had no opinion. The percentage who said `` yes '' rose to 86 percent among those who went to mass `` several times a year '' and to 93 percent among those who went to church `` at least once a week ''. Even non-churchgoers supported the crucifix, with 68 percent of people who said they never went to mass in favour of displaying it in schools. Political commentator Renato Mannheimer said a significant proportion of Italians see the crucifix primarily as a symbol of their country 's cultural and social traditions, though they do not deny its religious significance. The ECHR ruling came in a case brought by an Italian mother opposed to the presence of the crucifix in schools. Soile Lautsi took her fight to Strasbourg after Italian judges finally ruled against her following years of legal wrangling, declaring on more than one occasion that the crucifix had become as much a symbol of Italian national identity as of Catholicism. The ECHR found that the right of parents to educate their children according to their own beliefs, and children 's right to freedom of religion, were breached by the crucifix in classrooms. They could also be `` disturbing for pupils '' from other religions and ethnic minorities, the court found, declaring a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. The ISPO organisation surveyed 801 people for the poll, which had a 3.5 percent margin of error.

'' \underline{Gates} cited Pakistan 's `` success '' in the Swat Valley, where two million people fled a punishing military offensive against Taliban insurgents beginning in late April. The military says it has now cleared that area of insurgents, and about 1.3 million displaced people have returned.

'' \underline{Gates} added that \underline{he} was pleased with the security of Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal, calling the arrangements in place `` sufficient and adequate.

\par RETURN OF THE SECRET DONORS. To old political hands, wise to the ways of candidates and money, 1972 was a watershed year. \textbf{Richard M. Nixon} 's re-election campaign was awash in cash, secretly donated by corporations and individuals. Fred Wertheimer, a longtime supporter of campaign finance regulation, was then a lawyer for Common Cause. He vividly recalls the weeks leading up to April 7, 1972, before a new campaign finance law went into effect requiring the disclosure of the names of individual donors. `` Contributors, '' he said, `` were literally flying into Washington with satchels of cash. '' The Committee for the Re-Election of the President was also illegally hauling in many millions of dollars from corporations, many of which felt pressured into making contributions. The record of donors was so tightly held that it was kept in a locked drawer by Rose Mary Woods, \textbf{Nixon} 's secretary. The list -- which came to be known as `` Rose Mary 's Baby '' -- was n't released until Wertheimer forced the issue through a lawsuit. Among those on the list were \underline{William Keeler}, \underline{the chief executive of Phillips Petroleum, who pleaded guilty during the post-Watergate prosecutions to making an illegal corporate donation}. Rose Mary 's Baby itself, now an artifact of the nation 's biggest political scandal, sits in the Watergate collection of the National Archives. In this year 's midterm elections, there is no talk of satchels of cash from donors. Nor is there any hint of illegal actions reaching Watergate-like proportions. But the fundraising practices that earned people convictions in Watergate -- giving direct corporate money to a campaign and doing so secretly -- are back in a different form in 2010. This time around, the corporations are still giving secretly, but legally.

\par Eight out of ten \underline{Italians} back crucifix in schools : poll. An opinion poll on Sunday showed strong public support for displaying crucifixes in \underline{Italy} 's schools, five days after a European court ruled the practice breached human rights. More than eight out of ten \underline{Italians} said they supported crucifixes being shown in schools, according to a survey published in the Corriera della Sera newspaper. \underline{Italian} politicians of all sides united with the Catholic Church to condemn the November 3 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights -LRB- ECHR -RRB-, with Prime Minister \textbf{Silvio Berlusconi} describing it as `` unacceptable ''. In Sunday 's poll, 84 percent of people replied `` yes '' to the question `` Should crucifixes be displayed in classrooms ? '', 14 percent said `` no '' and 2 percent said they had no opinion. The percentage who said `` yes '' rose to 86 percent among those who went to mass `` several times a year '' and to 93 percent among those who went to church `` at least once a week ''. Even non-churchgoers supported the crucifix, with 68 percent of people who said they never went to mass in favour of displaying it in schools. Political commentator Renato Mannheimer said a significant proportion of \underline{Italians} see the crucifix primarily as a symbol of their country 's cultural and social traditions, though they do not deny its religious significance. The ECHR ruling came in a case brought by an \underline{Italian} mother opposed to the presence of the crucifix in schools. Soile Lautsi took her fight to Strasbourg after \underline{Italian} judges finally ruled against her following years of legal wrangling, declaring on more than one occasion that the crucifix had become as much a symbol of \underline{Italian} national identity as of Catholicism. The ECHR found that the right of parents to educate their children according to their own beliefs, and children 's right to freedom of religion, were breached by the crucifix in classrooms. They could also be `` disturbing for pupils '' from other religions and ethnic minorities, the court found, declaring a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. The ISPO organisation surveyed 801 people for the poll, which had a 3.5 percent margin of error.

He has always been a tough opponent.

She has, for example, called for the elimination of the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, denounced the BP compensation fund for victims of the oil spill as a slush fund, and suggested that her candidacy was a mission for God. In recent days, there have been a number of events that suggest Angle is trying to change the way she is doing things. The interview itself was a break from past practice, and after that, she took a few questions from reporters at a brief news conference.

\par \textbf{Goldman} fined $ 650,000 for disclosure lapse. Industry regulators have fined \textbf{Goldman Sachs} $ 650,000 for failing to disclose that two of its brokers, including the executive accused of leading the mortgage securities deal that brought civil fraud charges against the firm, were under investigation by the government. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced the fine Tuesday, saying \textbf{Goldman} lacked adequate procedures to ensure that the required disclosure was made for Fabrice Tourre, a \textbf{Goldman} vice president. \textbf{Goldman} made that report last May, more than seven months after Tourre received a notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was considering filing charges against him, FINRA said. \textbf{Goldman} settled the SEC 's fraud charges in July, paying a record $ 550 million. The case was the most significant legal action related to the mortgage meltdown that pushed the country into recession. \textbf{\textbf{Goldman} 's} failure to disclose the information about the brokers `` impacted the ability of FINRA and other securities regulators to discharge their registration, examination and oversight duties, and limited the ability of investors ... to adequately assess the -LRB- two -RRB- individuals through FINRA 's public disclosure program, BrokerCheck, '' James Shorris, FINRA executive vice president and acting chief of enforcement, said in a statement. The Wall Street titan neither admitted nor denied FINRA 's allegations in agreeing to pay the fine. \textbf{Goldman} also agreed to review \textbf{its} supervision procedures for disclosures and to make any needed changes. `` We 're pleased to put this matter behind us, '' said \textbf{Goldman} spokesman \underline{Michael DuVally} in New York. He declined further comment. The second broker was n't named because, the regulator said, that person was n't named in any SEC complaints. FINRA did n't specify whether the notice from the SEC that the second broker received also was related to the charges that \textbf{Goldman} misled buyers of mortgage-linked investments. The SEC had alleged in that case that \textbf{Goldman} sold mortgage invstments without telling buyers that the securities had been crafted with input from a client that was betting on them to fail.

\par \textbf{Gates} praises Pakistan 's grip on extremists. US \underline{Defense} Secretary \textbf{Robert Gates} on Monday praised Pakistan 's handling of extremist threats, hailing the army and government 's unpredicted `` success '' and saying they had `` performed admirably. '' \textbf{Gates} said the performance of both Pakistan 's military and civilian government over the past 16 months had exceeded Washington 's expectations, in an interview with Al-Jazeera, the Qatar-based satellite news channel. `` \textbf{I} think if you look back, 15 or 16 months, the Pakistani government has performed admirably, '' \textbf{Gates} said, according to a transcript. `` \textbf{I} believe that the Pakistani government, both the civilian side and the military side, have performed better than almost anyone 's expectations in the region, or in this country, or elsewhere, and we are very impressed by that and we are prepared to be helpful, to help the Pakistanis in any way we can. '' \textbf{Gates} cited Pakistan 's `` success '' in the Swat Valley, where two million people fled a punishing military offensive against Taliban insurgents beginning in late April. The military says it has now cleared that area of insurgents, and about 1.3 million displaced people have returned. But skirmishes continue, raising fears that the Taliban are regrouping in the mountains. `` \textbf{I} think people would not have predicted the success of the Pakistani army, '' \textbf{Gates} said. `` \textbf{I} think people would not have predicted the success in the Pakistani government 's effective dealing with internally displaced persons as a result of a military operation and how many of them have returned to Swat and how effective the Pakistani government has been in this respect. '' \textbf{He} also hailed the government 's ability to forge political consensus to take on extremists. `` No one \textbf{I} think would have predicted the political consensus that has emerged in Pakistan in terms of the effort to take on these violent extremists in the North West Frontier Province, in the Fata -LSB- Federally Administered Tribal Areas -RSB- and in that area. '' \textbf{Gates} added that \textbf{he} was pleased with the security of Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal, calling the arrangements in place `` sufficient and adequate. '' `` \textbf{I} 'm quite comfortable that the security arrangements for the Pakistani nuclear capabilities are sufficient and adequate, '' \textbf{he} said. \textbf{He} said that assessment was `` based both on our own understanding of the security arrangements that the Pakistanis have for their weapons and their capabilities, their laboratories and so on.

The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea issued a statement that said `` neither peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula nor peace and security in Northeast Asia are thinkable as long as the U.S. forces are present in \underline{South Korea}. '' The United States was the `` arch criminal, '' who divided Korea into the north and the south, bringing misfortune and pain to the Korean Peninsula and it was `` the root cause '' of aggression and war, the statement said.

\par RETURN OF THE SECRET DONORS. To old political hands, wise to the ways of candidates and money, 1972 was a watershed year. Richard M. Nixon 's re-election campaign was awash in cash, secretly donated by corporations and individuals. Fred Wertheimer, a longtime supporter of campaign finance regulation, was then a lawyer for Common Cause. He vividly recalls the weeks leading up to April 7, 1972, before a new campaign finance law went into effect requiring the disclosure of the names of individual donors. `` Contributors, '' he said, `` were literally flying into Washington with satchels of cash. '' The Committee for the Re-Election of the President was also illegally hauling in many millions of dollars from corporations, many of which felt pressured into making contributions. The record of donors was so tightly held that it was kept in a locked drawer by Rose Mary Woods, Nixon 's secretary. The list -- which came to be known as `` Rose Mary 's Baby '' -- was n't released until Wertheimer forced the issue through a lawsuit. Among those on the list were \textbf{William Keeler}, \textbf{the chief executive of \underline{Phillips Petroleum}, who pleaded guilty during the post-Watergate prosecutions to making an illegal corporate donation}. Rose Mary 's Baby itself, now an artifact of the nation 's biggest political scandal, sits in the Watergate collection of the National Archives. In this year 's midterm elections, there is no talk of satchels of cash from donors. Nor is there any hint of illegal actions reaching Watergate-like proportions. But the fundraising practices that earned people convictions in Watergate -- giving direct corporate money to a campaign and doing so secretly -- are back in a different form in 2010. This time around, the corporations are still giving secretly, but legally.

\par BlackBerry says it will not let India monitor messages. The maker of BlackBerry insisted on Wednesday it would not allow the Indian government to monitor encrypted emails but said it hoped for a rapid solution to recent concerns over national security. BlackBerry 's woes in India, one of its biggest markets, come as Saudi Arabia announced a suspension of BlackBerry operations starting Friday because security agencies can not monitor messages. The United Arab Emirates has also said it would halt BlackBerry email, messenger and other services from October on the same grounds. \textbf{Canada-based Research in Motion} -LRB- RIM -RRB-, maker of the smartphone, denied local media reports it would allow Indian intelligence agencies to read BlackBerry messages to satisfy government security concerns of the government. `` We look forward to a solution -LRB- with the Indian government -RRB-, nobody likes to be in such a situation, a solution should be feasible, '' \underline{RIM spokesman \underline{Satchit Gayakwad}} told AFP. `` But there can be no compromise on security for our customers' communications. '' India, battling insurgencies from Muslim-majority Kashmir to the far-flung northeast and mounting Maoist unrest, is highly sensitive about potential risks of new technology. It has raised fears BlackBerry services could be used by militants to communicate. A telecom ministry spokesman in India said efforts to resolve the security concerns involving BlackBerry, which has around one million customers in India, were `` ongoing. '' The Economic Times on Wednesday quoted an unnamed security agency official as saying India, the world 's fastest growing cellular market, would close BlackBerry services that can not be monitored. The RIM spokesman said BlackBerry had held discussions with India 's Department of Telecommunications on the dispute but gave no details. India has demanded encryption details to track BlackBerry services but the Canadian company says even it can not read the encrypted information. `` We feel there can be a highly secure solution which satisfies the needs of government without compromising BlackBerry 's security standards, '' \underline{Gayakwad} said. `` If it is corporate data they need, there might be other ways they could do it -LRB- get access -RRB-, and we need not decrypt ourselves, '' \underline{he} said.
\par Five killed in cafe explosion in \underline{Ethiopia}. At leave five people were killed and 20 others injured on Saturday in a cafe explosion in \underline{\underline{Ethiopia} 's} northern region of Tigray. Tigray 's administrator Micheal Abraha said the explosion was carried out by neighboring Eritrea with an aim to jeopardize \underline{\underline{Ethiopia} 's} national elections on May 23. President of the Tigray Regional State, \textbf{Tsegay Berhe}, also said Eritrean agents were responsible for the attack. `` Ethiopian elections wo n't be disrupted despite Eritrea 's attempts to do so, '' he said. There was no immediate comment from the Eritrean government. Relations between Eritrea and \underline{Ethiopia} had long been strained since Eritrea formally gained its independence from \underline{Ethiopia} in 1993 after a 30-year war. Tensions between the two countries escalated after \underline{Ethiopia} and Eritrea fought a brutal border war from 1998 to 2000.
\par RETURN OF THE SECRET DONORS. To old political hands, wise to the ways of candidates and money, 1972 was a watershed year. \textbf{Richard M. Nixon} 's re-election campaign was awash in cash, secretly donated by corporations and individuals. Fred Wertheimer, a longtime supporter of campaign finance regulation, was then a lawyer for Common Cause. He vividly recalls the weeks leading up to April 7, 1972, before a new campaign finance law went into effect requiring the disclosure of the names of individual donors. `` Contributors, '' he said, `` were literally flying into Washington with satchels of cash. '' The Committee for the Re-Election of the President was also illegally hauling in many millions of dollars from corporations, many of which felt pressured into making contributions. The record of donors was so tightly held that it was kept in a locked drawer by \underline{Rose Mary Woods}, \textbf{Nixon} 's secretary. The list -- which came to be known as `` \underline{Rose Mary 's} Baby '' -- was n't released until Wertheimer forced the issue through a lawsuit. Among those on the list were William Keeler, the chief executive of Phillips Petroleum, who pleaded guilty during the post-Watergate prosecutions to making an illegal corporate donation. \underline{Rose Mary 's} Baby \underline{itself}, now an artifact of the nation 's biggest political scandal, sits in the Watergate collection of the National Archives. In this year 's midterm elections, there is no talk of satchels of cash from donors. Nor is there any hint of illegal actions reaching Watergate-like proportions. But the fundraising practices that earned people convictions in Watergate -- giving direct corporate money to a campaign and doing so secretly -- are back in a different form in 2010. This time around, the corporations are still giving secretly, but legally.
\par DPRK says U.S. occupation in S. Korea destroys Peninsula 's peace, reunification. The Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LRB- DPRK -RRB- Wednesday said the U.S. occupation in South Korea destroys peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. The \textbf{Central Committee of the Democratic Front} for the Reunification of \underline{Korea} issued a statement that said `` neither peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula nor peace and security in Northeast Asia are thinkable as long as the U.S. forces are present in South Korea. '' The United States was the `` arch criminal, '' who divided \underline{Korea} into the north and the south, bringing misfortune and pain to the Korean Peninsula and it was `` the root cause '' of aggression and war, the statement said. The statement urged the United States to understand the mounting anti-U.S. sentiment of the Koreans, withdraw its forces from South Korea, stop the moves for an aggression war against the DPRK, and refrain from any acts obstructive to the independent and peaceful reunification of \underline{Korea}. The statement called upon all parties and groups and people to drive the U.S. forces out of South Korea, and `` turn out as one in the sacred anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. ''

\par Eight out of ten Italians back crucifix in schools : poll. An opinion poll on Sunday showed strong public support for displaying crucifixes in Italy 's schools, five days after a European court ruled the practice breached human rights. More than eight out of ten Italians said they supported crucifixes being shown in schools, according to a survey published in the Corriera della Sera newspaper. Italian politicians of all sides united with the Catholic Church to condemn the November 3 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights -LRB- \underline{ECHR} -RRB-, with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi describing it as `` unacceptable ''. In Sunday 's poll, 84 percent of people replied `` yes '' to the question `` Should crucifixes be displayed in classrooms ? '', 14 percent said `` no '' and 2 percent said they had no opinion. The percentage who said `` yes '' rose to 86 percent among those who went to mass `` several times a year '' and to 93 percent among those who went to church `` at least once a week ''. Even non-churchgoers supported the crucifix, with 68 percent of people who said they never went to mass in favour of displaying it in schools. Political commentator Renato Mannheimer said a significant proportion of Italians see the crucifix primarily as a symbol of their country 's cultural and social traditions, though they do not deny its religious significance. The \underline{ECHR} ruling came in a case brought by an Italian mother opposed to the presence of the crucifix in schools. \textbf{Soile Lautsi} took \textbf{her} fight to Strasbourg after Italian judges finally ruled against \textbf{her} following years of legal wrangling, declaring on more than one occasion that the crucifix had become as much a symbol of Italian national identity as of Catholicism. \underline{The \underline{ECHR}} found that the right of parents to educate their children according to their own beliefs, and children 's right to freedom of religion, were breached by the crucifix in classrooms. They could also be `` disturbing for pupils '' from other religions and ethnic minorities, the court found, declaring a breach of \underline{the \underline{European Convention} on Human Rights}. The ISPO organisation surveyed 801 people for the poll, which had a 3.5 percent margin of error.
